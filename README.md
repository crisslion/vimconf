# vimconf
## My personal vim configuration
> I always worked with vim without plugins because it was a hassle to install everything, but in the wake of using some great, but quite slow editors like Visual studio code and atom, I felt that I needed to boost my productivity a bit, so I picked pugins and config that works the best for me and I can deploy on new system in a minute. If it helps you, awesome :)

## Installation
- Copy `.vimrc` (and rename if neccessary) to your home folder
- Copy autoload folder with `plug.vim` plugin to your `.vim` folder (or other where vim stores plugins in your system)
- Open Vim, ignore errors, and run `:PlugInstall`
- Close and run vim again
- Happy viming
